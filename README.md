This patch simply correct ECAM values for LVFR/HorizonSim A32xCEO (you know, CFM56 and V2500) and A320-21X CFM flaps CONF Full at 35deg (rather than 40deg on IAE, and CFM LEAP)


Well, these engines don't idle at 68% N2 like CFM LEAP do, rather around 60% for both CFM/IAE while different N1 achieves (19% for CFM56 and 22% for V2500)
